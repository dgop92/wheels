# Wheels

The core idea is an application to enable the car sharing concept however, this project only contains a simple API to interact with the core algorithm that solve the problem of:

_given driver, passenger list and common destination compute the optimal route the driver should take to pick up all passengers_

## Motivation

My main motivation for creating the project was "to learn c# and .NET". This is why the code is pretty basic, but I strive to implement a clean architecture.

## Requirements

- .NET 6

## What I learned

- Basics of C#
- Basics of .NET
- Minimal API's
- Basic unit testing with mstest
